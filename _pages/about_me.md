I'm Jiachen Xu, the Ph.D. student at the University of Vienna, Austria. I obtained my master degree with distinction from Technical University of Munich (TUM), Munich, Germany in 2019 and bachelor degree from Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), Beijing, China in 2016. 

Before moving to Vienna, I wrote my master thesis and did my internship in the [BCI-group of Max Planck Institute for Intelligent System (MPI-IS)](https://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/jxu) in TÃ¼bingen, Germany, supervised by [Dr. Vinay Jayaram](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-o1ap9MAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Dr. Moritz Grosse-Wentrup](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=15GNzKcAAAAJ). My research interests include brain-computer interface, neural signal processing, machine learning, differential geometry and brain stimulation.
